### A set of Klipper macros with prompts for filament loading and more

## Description
This is a collection of Klipper macros for loading and unload filament and handleing filament runouts and color changes in a similar style to Prusa.
What's unquie about these macros if they use Mainsail prompts as a helpful aide.

These macros where designed around the Orbiter Filament Sensor, but it will work with any filament sensor that is a switch. You just need to assign the pin in the config. The  Orbiter Filament Sensor also has a button for unload, which many filament sensors do not have. So in this case you would just call the unload macro in Mailsail or the like. 

Macros included:

- Filament Load
- FIlament Unload
- Filament Runout
- Color Change M600 (WIP)
- Pause
- Resume
- Cancel

The main features are:

- Lots of helpful [prompts](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/overview/features/macro-prompts) that guide you through the process
- Material temperature profiles. Add custom material profiles for whatever you might be printing.
- Optional Beep (M300) command can be played at stages of load and unload
- Temperture Checks and temperature recovery if [idle timeout](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html?h=idle#idle_timeout) is reached.
- Filament Checks during loading to make sure there is acutally filament loaded

A short demo because [a video is worth a 1000 words](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ou3CjtsuDTo)

## Install
1. Download Â´flap_main.cfgÂ´ and Â´flap_temp_control.cfgÂ´
2. Place both files in your Klipper config folder
3. Open Â´flap_main.cfgÂ´ and assign your pins
4. Have a look at the options in the config and customize to your liking
5. Open Â´flap_temp_control.cfgÂ´ and have a look at the material profiles and see if they are to your liking
6. Restart and try it out

## Todo
1. Long term testing
2. Testing on Klipper Screen (mine is in the mail)
3. Optimize macros by using lists 
4. Fixing bugs that will probably appear ðŸ™ƒ
