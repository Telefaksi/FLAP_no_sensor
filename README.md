# Filament Loading À la Prusa (FLÀP) 

### A set of Klipper macros for filament loading

## Description
This is a collection of Klipper macros for loading and unloading filament in a similar style to how a Prusa MK3 handles it. 

These macros were made to work with the Orbiter Filament sensor however it will work a simple filament sensor that is a swtich. It will even without a filament sensor. You just need to call the macros manually. 


## Features
- Tries to replicate the MK3 load / unload experience
- Runout detection with pause and resume 
- Lots of customization. Don't like something? Check the config and turn it off.
- Material specific loading tempertures. One temperture for loading all filaments does not work. 
- Prompts! It will ask you "What material are you loading?"
- It's smart, even when you're dumb. Did you forget to load filament when starting a print? It will tell you.
